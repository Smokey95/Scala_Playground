## Scala Playground
Playground for Scala used in the course Software Engineering at HTWG Konstanz

### Usage
Just a space to test Scala :) <br>

This is a normal sbt project. You can compile code with `sbt compile`, run it with `sbt run`, and `sbt console` will start a Scala 3 REPL.

For more information on the sbt-dotty plugin, see the
[scala3-example-project](https://github.com/scala/scala3-example-project/blob/main/README.md).
